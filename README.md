# Product_Classification
In this project, we develop a classification system for online products based on product information with machine learning and deep learning model. 
* data_crawling: download data from "New World" (https://www.ishopnewworld.co.nz/)
* data_classification: build classification system for products based on machine learning (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, GBDT) and deep learning model (FastText, LSTM, TextCNN) with word embedding (word2vec and EDA)
* EDA is an easy data augmentation for text data. This method is based on the paper (**EDA: Easy Data Augmentation Techniques for Boosting Performance on Text Classification Tasks**)
